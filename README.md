“Looped” is a comprehensive web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack that enables users to experience a seamless e-commerce journey. With a robust feature set, it allows users to create accounts, log in, browse and purchase products, review their order history, and log out with ease.

The application leverages the power of Mongoose, Express, React, and Node to deliver a smooth and intuitive user experience. By utilizing Mongoose, the application establishes a connection to a MongoDB database, facilitating efficient storage and retrieval of user accounts, products, and order data. Express serves as the backend framework, handling routing and providing a RESTful API for seamless communication between the client and server.

On the frontend, React is utilized to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Users can easily navigate the application, add products to their cart, and proceed to checkout with a few clicks. The modern and user-friendly interface ensures an engaging shopping experience.

Developers interested in exploring or contributing to “Looped” can easily do so by forking or cloning the repository. Upon setting up the application on their local machine, running npm i in the project’s directory will quickly install all the necessary dependencies for the application to run smoothly.

To establish a connection to the database, developers need to create a .env file in the project’s root directory. In this file, they should provide a valid MONGODB_URI link, allowing the application to interact seamlessly with the database. Additionally, a SECRET key should be included in the .env file to enhance security.

Once the environment is set up, developers have the freedom to make customizations, enhancements, or run tests according to their needs. Running npm run dev will launch the application in development mode, providing real-time previews of changes made. For testing purposes, developers can execute npm run tests to run any pre-defined tests and ensure the robustness of the application.

In summary, “Looped” is a feature-rich web application developed using the MERN stack, offering users a comprehensive e-commerce experience. Its versatility and detailed documentation make it an ideal starting point for developers looking to learn, contribute, or build upon a full-stack application.
